*The impact of security, privacy and technology on our daily lives*

There are three areas where much of our lives will be decided over the next
decade or two...that being technology and how we deal with the security and
privacy aspects of having that technology.

The world is a digital place now, regardless of how any person thinks of it. We
use it to have maps of the world, most of humanity's knowledge and a pulse of
everything going on in the world...in our fingertips at any time. The current cost
of that is that our lives and privacy are also online, exploited by the government,
companies that profit from it, and hackers too.

But we as individuals decide how we face digital choices. There are ways to
balance having technology and having privacy. This blog explores those, mostly
my own search for that balance, and hopefully to add a voice to help others.

Comments and feedback are always welcome (public or private), as long as you're
not trying to help me optimize my SEO rankings or other crap like that.

Thanks for reading!

Danny
