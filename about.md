*The impact of security, privacy and technology on our daily lives*

The fate of our digital lives will be decided in the coming years, how we use technology and deal with the security and privacy aspects of technology.

The world is a digital place now. We have maps of the world, store most of humanity's knowledge, and a keep a pulse of everything going on in the world. All at our fingertips at any time. The cost is that our lives and privacy are also online, exploited by the government, companies that profit from it, and hackers too.

But we as individuals decide how we face digital choices, to balance having technology and having privacy. This blog explores my own search for that balance, and to add a voice to help others.

Comments and feedback are always welcome.

Thanks for reading!

Danny
